# A terminal resume...

Ok, so that makes it sound worse than it is. About a year or so ago I decided to use what I had learned in jQuery to put together a page that looks and works pretty much like a terminal on Mac, and to be honest I'm rather happy with the results.

The code does need a lot of tidying up though as it's not the best example of my jQuery skillz but please fell free to fork away and have a little fun with it. You can find it running at http://onishiweb.co.uk/resume

## Issues:

*	Change long if statements to case statements.
*	Re-write markup in HTML5
